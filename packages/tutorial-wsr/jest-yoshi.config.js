// The purpose of this file is to start your server and possibly additional servers
// like RPC/Petri servers.
//
// Because tests are running in parallel, it should start a different server on a different port
// for every test file (E2E and server tests).
//
// By attaching the server object (testkit result) on `globalObject` it will be available to every
// test file globally by that name.
